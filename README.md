Economics of Climate Adptation
The Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology offers a systematic and transparent approach that combines probabilistic risk modelling techniques of CLIMADA (https://wcr.ethz.ch/research/climada.html) with in-depth, inter-sectoral stakeholder discussions. The framework provides decision makers with information about potential climate-related damage to their environment, economies and societies. By quantifying future climate risks, ECA studies help decision makers to identify and prioritise cost-effective climate change adaptation measures for a variety of sectors.
This repository showcases the three research studies across three different geographical regions that were funded by the InsuResilience Solutions Fund programme, financed by KfW Development Bank on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and is published as joint cooperation by Frankfurt School of Finance & Management gGmbH and United Nations University (UNU-EHS).
